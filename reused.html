                        Drones from DATA PKT gather high-quality aerial data and convert it into 3D point clouds to
                        aid in mapping roads in need of repair. Our image processing software uses this for pothole
                        detection and encroachment identification using comparative monthly video project reports.
                        The prompt discovery of any abnormalities after the construction of roadways and highways
                        aids in the protection of lives that might otherwise be lost due to unsafe road conditions.
